Purpose
=====

This is a website for Ender the puppy, a 6 week old siberean husky.

Technology
=====
Some of the technologies it uses includes:
- Node.js
- Express
- Amazon-S3
- ImageMagick
- Mongoose/MongoDB
- Jade Templating
- Stylus CSs

Functionality
=====

This application allows photo uploading to Amazon S3 using the Amazon Web Services SDK. Before uploading, it resizes the image to have a width of 1000px. Once uploaded it stores the photo url in mongoose, and can retrieve the images and display them.  It relies on a restful architecture for the creation and retrieval of photos.

In the Future
=====

I'm still building out the front-end for the project, and the way the viewer actually interacts with the project.  Check back for updates coming soon!
