Technology
=====

This is a website for Ender the husky.  Some of the technologies it uses includes:
- Node.js
- Express
- Amazon-S3
- Mongoose/MongoDB
- Jade Templating
- Stylus CSs

Functionality
=====

This application allows photo uploading to Amazon S3 using the Amazon Web Services SDK.  Once uploaded it stores the photo url in mongoose, and can retrieve the images and display them.  It relies on a restful architecture for the creation and retrieval of photos.

In the Future
=====

I'm still building out the front-end for the project, and the way the viewer actually interacts with the project.  Check back for updates coming soon!
